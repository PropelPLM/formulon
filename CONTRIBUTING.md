## Ways of Helping out

### Finding differences in Salesforce Formula behaviour and Formulon

Formulon imitates the behaviour of the original Salesforce Formula implementation. It will not always yield the same results.

If you come a across a discrepancy, [raise an issue](https://github.com/leifg/formulon/issues/new) with the formula and the expected result (ideally without any variables)

### Implementing missing behaviour

At this point not all formula functions have been implemented. For every formula there is, there is an issue, so go ahead and pick what you want to implement.
